# cascade
cascade is a layout a friend and i cooked up. the primary focus of the layout is to maximise inrolls while keeping sfb fairly low. it's heavily inspired by apt, but has its own changes to hold unique to itself.

i'm currently using cascade-thumb, a mod for cascade that puts "w" on the left thumb. this decreases sfb even more and helps with hand pains that i deal with individually.
